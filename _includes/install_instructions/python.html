Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    Python is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well.  
	While one can install Python from many sources, please use the link to the installer below. This will provide
	the conda package manager in addition to Python as well as conform to government licensing requirements.

    We will teach Python using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>,
    a programming environment that runs in a web browser (Jupyter Notebook will be installed by miniforge during our lesson). For this to work you will need a reasonably
    up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
    Firefox browsers are all
    <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
    (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
    and below, are not).
